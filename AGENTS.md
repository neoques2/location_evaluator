# Developer Notes

- Record any setup steps or meta preferences here for future contributions.
- Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` before running tests.
- Run tests via `pytest -q`.
- Write unit tests for new functions and integration tests when suitable.
- Keep comments brief and prefer using high level libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `enum`).
- Avoid passing data via raw strings if structured types fit better.
- Follow DRY and prefer clear abstractions.
- Future commits should update this file with additional findings.
